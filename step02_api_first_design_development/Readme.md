# Step02 - API-First Design and Developments

## Class Notes

- [API-first software development for modern organizations](https://medium.com/better-practices/api-first-software-development-for-modern-organizations-fdbfba9a66d3)

  - Best practice for developing an App is to create an api and build UI against it. If we code UI first this comes with aa fallback that if there is some restriction to the API and App is actullay using such feature which can't be processed so we need to update the app which consumes lot of resources and time. Other is to code the api first and in API first aproach there are two ways first is code first and second is API first.
  - In code first, we develop an API on some IDE and deploy it and after that we use some ADE and test it and write documentation based on that.
  - API design first approach is the one where we design the schema first in some ADE, create mock server and write some tests, create code based on and add it to IDE and then deploy it. API first development is to develop the API first and API desgin is planning api functionality first, right way is API desgin first.
  - API first approach gives us the benifit of earlier validation, clear abstraction layer, decoupling dependancies, faster growth and freedom for constraints.

  - With API first approch if API is designed poorly it can cause errors and complications in the futue. So there is need to desgin it based on future usage.
  - Tools which can be used for API first development are postman, swaggerHub, FastApi, Api manager and ReadyAPI

- [API-First, API Design-First, or Code-First](https://blog.stoplight.io/api-first-api-design-first-or-code-first-which-should-you-choose)
  - For clarity there are three ways to build API, code first, api first and design first. The best way is to design first. In design first process every person of the team participate in the designing process.
